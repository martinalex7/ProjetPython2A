See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

[Bridge: The Weeknd & KayCyy]
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh), oh (Oh, yeah)
I know You won't, I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't139EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

It's after hours at that glamorous night spot
And they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm
It's the life of the party, to think I could've almost died
Lord, help us

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama, please tell her I said, ""Say something""
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh
I heard passing by in a stroller remindin' me, ""Hey, keep rolling""
I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a *****
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later
All that time, y'all thought a ***** was high, thought I was crazy
My mom, she ain't cut no corners
Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life ****
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this:
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were ****
So pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
Sh-sh, ah, ah
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married
Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite, 'twas her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though
[Chorus: Kanye West, The Notorious B.I.G. & Diddy]
Straight from Shibuya, on some zen
We back, ramped up, we on ten
It's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (C'mon)
Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (Uh)
We gon' win big (What?)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Southside gang mentality weigh heavy
I was thinkin' out the box even in a Box Chevy
And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy
'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley (The life of the party)
I ain’t turn in homework for like four months and I bet she let me
She saw the vision
""Yeezy you special, go make your own decisions then""
Man, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce
They tried to take my voice away, I ain't try to take ya choice away
I just prayed the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a slip-up
Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage ya, good Lord
Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with
The paparazzi never really got what my angle is
They treat my married life like some type of entanglement
My neighbor still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't sayin' it
I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit
I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it
God has said himself to make sure that the baby live
And if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this here?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute
Let me stop playing with it, hopped in a Lamb' with it
Hopped in a Lamb' with it, in a damn pandemic
Nerve of Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it
[Chorus: Kanye West, The Notorious B.I.G. & Diddy]
Listen, straight from Shibuya, on some zen
I'm on ten, it's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (C'mon)
Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (Uh)
We gon' win big (What?)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Do y'all feel me? Really?
Get off Scott Free, I'm talking Ridley
Get off our knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees and let's get free
Get off your knees and let's get free
Really, I mean really
Really, I mean really
I need release, I don't need police
I'm like, ""****, puh-lease""
Y'all can't hear me, (Harmonizing), for the real me
For the real me, I mean, mhmm-mm

[Outro: DMX]
Alright, it's gonna shoot us in the— woah, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ready mama? (Yup)
I'm so proud of you, yup, you're gonna have so much fun
They gonna shoot us in the air, mama, okay?
C'mon, P, I got you, it's okay, mama
Hold your head back, hold your head back (Three, two, one)
Daddy's here, daddy's here, daddy's right here
It's okay, mama, daddy's here, daddy here
Help, help, daddy's right here, I'm scared
Okay, okay, I got you, it's okay
Okay, we goin' slow, we goin' slow down
It's okay, stop cryin', daddy got you, see, it's over, you did it, P!
You already did it! See? It's already over! Yay! You did it!
Big Girl! It's already over! It's already over, it's already over (The life of the party)
Daddy right here, daddy right here ('Til I almost cried)
I told you I'm not gon' let you go
I'm not gon' let you go, mama, okay?

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid

Took off His list, list, list

Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, ""Get behind me""
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me

Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)
Hallelujah (Yes)

Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight

[Chorus: Kanye West with Tyler, The Creator]
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned

Tell me how auntie been
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life

Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining

You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
[Bridge: Buju Banton]
Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said ""You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you""
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
[Chorus: Kanye West]

You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Now, we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin’ by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I’ve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin’ in
I know I madе a promise that I’d never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I’ve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain’t no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)
Devil like, ""Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped""
I don't say ""What's up?"", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no ""I"" in ""Team"", it's an ""I"" in ""Win"" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)
[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles
Ghost

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
And we done been a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said ""You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you""
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life, yeah

I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it

Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party

But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""

Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Pulled up on Ye, and I said, ""They don't understand me""

Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was ""Bang, Bang""
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside

And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, ""Free the old man""
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Now, we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin’ by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I’ve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin’ in
I know I madе a promise that I’d never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I’ve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain’t no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)
Devil like, ""Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped""
I don't say ""What's up?"", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no ""I"" in ""Team"", it's an ""I"" in ""Win"" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)
[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles
Ghost

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
And we done been a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me

They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers

Stay off them blogs, they play with y'all thoughts
Made a way from my dawgs that ain't say what they saw
Only the brave, they want us locked in the cage
If you owe me money, I shouldn't have to remind you to pay
Vacheron with my Ralph Lauren
How this bitch a full time leech and still beg on the side?
Off the meds, can't get out of the bed
Paparazzi waitin' like that mall on the Dawn of the Dead
I don't know you, my dawg, step away from the bus
Know they want me to fall, but my balance is just
You weren't with me when them struggles and battles was tough
So I cut your head off 'fore I give you a cut
When they tell me I can't do it, it give me a rush
Ain't got this type of bank account 'less you 50 and up

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
Your value is internal

I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder
[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)

I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th
[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir, Natalie Greene]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war357EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good He's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about Him
I love Him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body, I love Him so much
Because He's done so much for me
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there because He...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And He will reach out His hand and guide me through
Oh, yes He will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, He will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day He will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been He's always there
With His arms open wide
Accepting me

And I love Him so much
I couldn't do it without Him, I wouldn't want to

To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
Uh, I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him252EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Where the islands go

You say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

[Chorus: Kanye West]
But I still drove thirty hours
And I, I still drove thirty hours to you, yeah
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!
[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-
[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)

I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone

Yeah-yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

Walk all over me

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect)
(Southside)

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Yo)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, ""Get your money""
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant
[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2

Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...
[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
'Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him

La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!
[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-
[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)

You say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh

But I still drove thirty hours
And I, I still drove thirty hours to you, yeah

I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

Ahh!

I just talked to Jesus
He said, ""What up, Yeezus?""
I said, ""Shit—I'm chillin'

My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin

But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""

Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang

Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison, get your peace today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse

Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers

To all my second-string bitches, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony

Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We livin' in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (You know what time it is), watch us (You see us)
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

[Chorus: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power (Yeah)
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours (Yeah)
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
No one man should have all that power

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes, you gon' stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, ""Is this what this all comes to?""
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you?
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They tryna Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this!
[Chorus: Kanye West, John Legend & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power
Yea-ey-yea-ey-yeah-ey!

Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug, now it’s time to get the power back
Clap, clap

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols
But you could 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit
[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan

Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say ""As-salamu alaykum"", say ""Wa alaikum as-salaam""
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we gon' stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs

Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy (Ayy!)
Homie, I should be rewarded (Woo!)
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh? (Woo!)

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)

Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, ""Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?""
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to ""Cash Rules""
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, ""You lookin' good, fly colored Asian""
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ****, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough

Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan

We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Selling kilos through your iPod Nano

Money drive you crazy—look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh! On 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in

[Intro: Mos Def & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, yeah, there it go, there it is
This, is something special (uh-huh, yeah)
This, is something new (it's an amazing time)
This, is something special (look around)
This, is something new (the power of observation)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them? Sweet Jesus
Enlighten the Earth, seek heaven first
Let's put in this work
[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood, where did you acquire those Alaïas?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that's nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks, we ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche, then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back
[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord (you know, AK on the lamp like what's that?)
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (huh? Click clack)

All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening, I get it cracking
All black Carbon, on my wrist, yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too, if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean, or Mr. Boss
See me riding clean, in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy, but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me? I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood, in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck?
100 feet and better, what the fuck you stick?
Paparazzi on the water with the fuck-you stick
My face got the ""fuck you pricks""
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos, we do the goddamn thing
[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get down with the precious leathers
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, open glass on my fingers, I sit back like I'm caged
But still caking, my niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak, I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
That's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine, nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'
[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]

Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh
[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous

Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single

We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority

Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong

Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine

How can I be better? I could start with just the basics

I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script

Knowing that you're Milo, playing games like Cee-lo

You can have it your way like Carlito
My niggas would be happy to give y'all torpedoes
And have your car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front
I'm on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit
In the kitchen with the heat, making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it
My flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls-Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit
Straight licorice, you niggas sound ticklish
80K large for the Hermès dream
Purple croc in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Céline, Dion

High off life, this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali, more like rap-ology
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God where my city at
I'm like steak and fries but never died
They wanna Ghostface, wanna be me
But they will post-haste follow me into the afterlife
That means you going right after I've
But I'm the hero, sorta like Jack Sparrow
So some way, somehow, I have survived
Ha, ha, surprised?
Who is he that we see coming over the tides?
In a speed boat, boatload of pride
Fall of Rome, dress-shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant garde fashion collides
OMG, it's the C from the CRS
LOL-ing at you haters, tell your BFFs like

Loud as a badass child level

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, ""Trust me""
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, ""You won't leave me if you love me""
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, ""The end, question mark""

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Chorus: Mos Def & Kanye West]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view

Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay, now baby, here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby, this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean, ""Me go?"" Why can't it be, ""We go""?
What happens when people turn to tears? (Huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat (Do it!)
How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying, ""The world did this to me""
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your, ""Seans, you know I love you""
Shedding tears every day (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask ""Why?"" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees every day like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out, so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Yes!
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes, we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, ugh, for the following:
Fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I'll have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy, it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers...

CyHi!
Yeah!

[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t Black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m running through them circles, boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in, ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds asking niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothing silver-spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now, I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

... That no-smoke sec', rolling motherfucking ounces

Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers (Boy)
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (Houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dying
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool 'cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses—scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, everybody’s a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy

They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweller add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks

Here we go, like we should

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered
In the 1800s; y'all forget that
I got called ""Nigga"" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away, hanh! Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, ""Peace!""

Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust
[Verse 4: Consequence]
That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, ""You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man""
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
""Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy""

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down243EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)

I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

Hah, I am so outrageous

If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist

Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it

Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off

Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet

You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage

If one day, you just up and leave

I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

One day, I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, ""Get away""
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
[""The Best Birthday"": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]

I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh shit, I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before""
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ah

This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source

Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

Yeah, just a little bit
Just a little bit
And it goes...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of Ranges
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
And, some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions from some high-paid painters
Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless
And, a new relationship with a banker
And two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers
And, a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor
A young supermodel that shall remain nameless
Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes
All the money in the world don't make it painless, no

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
But they love it, and they love it, the more
The more you try to erase me
And they love it, and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it, and they love it, the more
The more that I appear, oh
Ugh, and they love it, and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it and they love it the more
The more you try the eraser
And they love it and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it and they love it the more
The more that you appear
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Plain Pat, what up?
Ugh, ugh, lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new, beautiful faces
At home, supermodel Myspaces
Long for they shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week, they want to see ID
Now, they got you in V.I.P., huh?
How many people almost famous?
You almost remember what they name is
Like ""Hey, didn't you play in?
No, it couldn't be, quit playin'""
And tryna keep that balance after MTV
That's a Real World Challenge
Back on that train
Never to be heard from again

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
But they love it, and they love it, the more
The more you try to erase me
And they love it, and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it, and they love it, the more

And they love it and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it and they love it the more
The more that you appear
[Verse 3: Pharrell]
G-R-I-P, P-I-M-P
I, any spelling, bitch, come on, that's me
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
Like an eye-drop of turpentine
You can listen to the serpent, fine
But the earth got gas; once it burps, it's fine
Some around me, they talk about degrees
Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key (Ugh)
Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold
No glove, scrub, man, he just over that stove
Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time
Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline
Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish
Eggshell off-white like a DuPont finish
Young, dumb, high-strung, who could handle us?
I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvases
'Cause who knew that day that man would just
Go to V.A. with a Tec and spray campuses?
What a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco, Thom Yorke, & Pharrell]
But they love it, and they love it, the more (To see it)
The more you try to erase me (As if he didn't do it)
And they love it, and they love it
The more, the more
And they love it, and they love it, the more
The more that I appear, oh
Ugh, and they love it, and they love it

Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning and—
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this
[Bridge: Kanye West & JAY-Z]

That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus 1]
Yes, I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy

That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 2]
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible
[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
[Bridge]
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort

And I'm still col' like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties (Bow!)
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid (No homo)
And I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice, and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried—suck my bat, bitch (ha!)

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa

In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today
[Chorus]
Damn, here we go again

And be looked at like a fucking hero

Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos

Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill, two doors from Tracey Ross

She asking about the speed boats, yeah, I admit we rented 'em

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

[Intro]
Stadium status

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that

What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to

You can't tell me nothing
Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane
[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra ""o""
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, [Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname ""Sorrow""
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
""Wait 'til I get my money"" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em
[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner

You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be""
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got 'em, Young Carter
On the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porsche, ha!
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
Ha! But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin, ha
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know
Ha! But watch how you speak
Cause in the street you can't trust every smile you meet, heh
And you ain’t important as the new edition is
Ralph Tresvant, ooh, they so sensitive
And it's the remix, baby!
And I'm a knock it out like Felix, baby, haha
God damn I'm fly
And my troop so cool, I don't have to lie
Hop in my car and go Kanye West
With my groovy new Louis Vuitton Damier vest
Ha! Yeah, let 'em hate though
I'm on my way to the bank, LMAO (wassup?)

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's one of the best to touch microphones
That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin'
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on

Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever, forever)
Everybody, everybody, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' 'bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

Uh, I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later, seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
Throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though, I still speak from my soul
Wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
Came in the game, he made his own lane
All I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, you need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
Father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds, throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
Studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever)
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment, uh
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like, ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Yeah, 'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, Lupe, touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd (Uh-huh)
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb (Yeah)
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth (Uh)
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge (Yeah)
To come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

You gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
'Fore the day you die (What?), you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl

Yeah, 'til the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How’d he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin’
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin’ to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I’m the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious (Uh-huh)
I got the custom grill (Yeah), I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, it's evident
You see a player flicking, now how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit? (Just a lil bit)
I got my custom kings, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green (Now what?)

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all–
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizz-ork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Interlude (Over Chorus): Kanye West]
Yeah, through the limits, to the wall
If y'all know this, sing along with it
What? I hear you, I hear you, I hear you
Through the– uh, through whatever, come
I can't hit that note either, fam
Yeah
Uh, uh, question
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It's more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If y'all could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
There's a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
Y'all thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
I look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so we turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the–
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things they seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And people gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' on cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, bring the drums in now, uh
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
London, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside
We gon' set this party off right
We set this party off right or what?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Okay, that's it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
That's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
Had hair so long that it looked like weave
She cut it all off, now she look like Eve
She dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Everybody say, ""All falls down""
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Let me hear you sing
And when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this (For real)
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean, a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, everybody say, ""All falls down""
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I can't hear you!
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""–– the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And George Bush get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, now everybody say
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now let me hear you say
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Let's go, let's go, lemme hear you say
One more time, one more time

One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
'Fore Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that'll shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better
Than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he-say, she-say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
[Bridge: Brandy & Kanye West]
What you calling?
(Feel something, feel something)
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
(Feel something, feel something
Feel something, feel something)
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone

We striving home (Yeah)
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, I'm at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

We striving home (What?)
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?
(Now see 'Quence, come on)

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child's gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, ""How long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years, doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Make some noise for Consequence, y'all
It's G.O.O.D. Music, baby
Out on these shores
2006, Don't Quit Your Day Job
I'ma get a string somethin' for a minute
Make some noise for the strings right now
They've been playing so beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree? The wire strings, that is
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh, on
Uh-uh, on, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I'm, uh, ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye, step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
Dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churro
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They say you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You will sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
Told 'em, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray
Is that my feet don't fail me now
(Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
To the hustlers, killers
Murderers, drug dealers, even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear he, hear he, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
We're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's how I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They said you could rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
I hope it take away from my sins
Bring the day that I dream about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
[Chorus: Kanye West & The Arc Choir]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
The Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm
And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
I gotta take all they bad a** to ShowBiz
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, we all got up in
They all went to din and then I had to pay
If you f***in' with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money
Uh, if you ain't no punk

Niggas repping the 'Go, but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtape
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison that run through their veins
And attacks they soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut (""Where you going?"")
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing (I ain't playing with y'all niggas)
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats hisself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own (Uh-huh)
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

Y'all bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dog, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale

I cop Ides by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'ma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'ma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, the Flic', and Do or Die (What up)
So first of all, who am I? (""The fuck is you?"")
My—My—My name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now, I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so live/smooth, there's nothing to prove (Ooh-OOH!)

You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and ""Do she need that beat tracked again?""
[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, ""Baby, that may be fake""
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there

Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check by check
If ""H to the Izzo"" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like, ""You don't care about my son's feelings?""
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?

Man, what could I do?

'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice in the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit résumés is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Masta Ace's
""Stand Up"", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubblegum

Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
'Cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs

Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe

You the type to run into a party, already tooted up
Can't get in? So you run, get a strap and shoot it up
Mad cause you not looted up, hoes said, ""He wasn't cute enough""
Tried his damnedest, couldn't do enough
Fuck star stats, we still car jack, hit it up
Runnin' through the man who flashin' that leather, give it up
My Taurus like to spark a lot, he ain't a player
He just talk a lot, we whupped his ass in the parkin' lot
Hopped back in the truck and lit the dutch
Now he on the ground lookin' double jointed as fuck
It's the R-H-Y, fuck tryin' to spell it
I live it how I tell it, get hoes like Tom Selleck
My clip gets hollow tips yours takes pellets (""I sweat it live"")
Sayin' my weed fly and I can't even smell it
I can see why you broke, punk nigga
My car is paid off, you a month-to-month nigga
I roll with ""I don't care throw him in the trunk"" niggas
Roll up to your high school just to jump niggas
Pussy ass niggas

Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like ""Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!""
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins

My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

I almost passed away oh yesterday but I'm blessed today
On top of the world I’m so thankful
It ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history

Niggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em
My pulse quickened, I
Brought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em
Niggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson
I got the belt like Lewis
I took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart
Back on the corner, back on the block
The Quincy Jones of hip hop, it's my time like Warner
Since I shine like Shyne in '99 with his
A lot of people talkin' real outta like with this
There's a war going on a few bitches wanna start with me
Showing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me
So I can live forever like diamonds
Throw your diamonds up, cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming
I hate a deadbeat nigga that rely on his man
See he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand
And go to every single barbershop and lie to the fans
So it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again
I'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E
They trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me
It's all R.O.C., it's all family tree
I got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee

Give 'em dap or pound 'em

Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn

I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard

The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said ""Who's the sissay?""
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya ""No hable ingle""

It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated

Na'mean - you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, ""You hold a gat, right?""
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive

But still
[Hook]
K-A-N-Y-E, Chi-Town playa out in NYC
She said she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans cuz the ass is free

[Verse 2]
I love girls, girls, I got a fetish for em
But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade off
If she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie Cochran
If she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothex
And a young girl off that X
And she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other
But that's a lady lover
I ain't even know that was ya baby mother
[Hook]

[Outro]
Explain the outro man, don't nobody never get to the outro
I just take a whole record and just
I'm not gonna talk about the producer shit right now
I just want niggas to realize my shit, you know what I'm saying
2002, aight
I sounded real mad on the last mixtape
I'm not even gonna go there this time, okEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down

Kanye West:
Man i promise shes so self conscious she has no idea what shes doing in college that major that she majored in dont make no money but she won't drop out her parents will look at her funny. Now tell me that ain't insecurrr. The concept of school seems so securrr. Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr. She like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of airs cause her baby daddy dont really care. Shes so precious with the peer pressure,couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexus. She had hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe single black female addicted to retail.and well

Chorus:
Kanye west:
Man i promise im so self conscious thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches rollies and poshers done drove me crazy i can't even pronounce nothing pass that ver-say-see. Then i spent 400 bucks on this just to be like nigga you ain't up on this. And i can't even go to the grocery store without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team it seems we living the american dream. But people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us,floss cause they degrade us,we trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper look how low we'll stoop even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe

Chorus:
Kanye West:
I say fuck the police thats how i treat em. We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy alot of clothes when we dont really need em things we buy to cover up whats inside. Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth thats why shortys hollering ""where the ballas at"". Drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack and a white man get paid off of all of that.

Yo, this Consequence
From the mighty Kon Man Clique
And I'm runnin' with my man Kanye West
And when I ain't got a pretty ho transporting a boy and a girl to the states
I'm either on the 1-9-2 or out in the Chi
So we gonna up y'all on how we chill, uh
Let's go

[Kanye West]
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridget
And get acquitted and break that bitch off, cause he ain't did it
Here go the Henny swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler, damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin' killer Cali gettin' weeded, make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many B.I.s, so much inspiration

[Consequence]
I get inspired by the stunts too
I've run through (uh), so many bitches in one crew
That now they riff over bones to pick
Till I find one, and slide one
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this
Cause Quence is famous for totin' stainless
[Kanye West]
Hey miss, who's there? No time to do hair
I'm through here, the show tonight, so get right
You look aight, let's club now
A rub down starts flavor while we grind in the theater
I'm tryin' to cut in the movies
I'm tryin' to give her something else to drink 'sides a smoothie

[Consequence]
Kids get broke when I take bank and win
With the gold chains, I throw game at your bitch like handball
Cause your boy's all that
So fall back, I be that real for '03 till

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till

[Verse Two: Consequence]
My mack game does me well
And makes them hoes want to go and kiss and tell
All of Quence's business, I cause dizziness
Any time I got to go and slap a silly trick
[Kanye West]
Yo, niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin', them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese

[Consequence]
When I'm postin' you better tell them hot heads, ""Stay cool""
Or exit because I'm the exception to the rule
I'm reppin' through the dudes blocks with two Glocks
To bury ya; when they tear they ain't jammin'
Them cannons will make you drop
So I'm doin' sliffs of indo, showin' off for hoes
Basically, my ace has been makin' them sick tracks
While I was shootin' pornos with your wisdom

[Kanye West]
Now bring some more stacks before you ask
About the price of the tracks; the game on smash
Look, don't change the facts about these plaques
'Cause in fact, my freestyle hours over powers
Brothers can't hack it, sensitive to truth and mack bitch
'03 me, Quence and Plain Pat bitch

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card

Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts

My raps is better than yours

You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 3: Common]
You was a vic in high school, now you a thug?
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price
On the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light, got fat girls eating right
[Outro: Kanye West & Common]
Haha, we in this bitch, yeah

Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it

It hurts, but it may be the only way

And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
(Uh)

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

Boom, b-boom, b-boom-boom

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog—
Fuck all that flirting—now, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (Just a lil bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it—

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home

How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer

When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if

Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda, raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause...
Dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the president—look, there's hope, man!

And what we gave back was crack music
And now, we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–

We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say?

Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me

There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because

As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better

Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post-Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
[Bridge: Tony Williams & Nas]
Ba-dop-ba-ba (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!

[Chorus: Really Doe & Tony Williams]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and (Ba-dop-ba-ba)
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (Oh, oh, oh, ooh!)
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (Ba-dop-ba-ba)

[Spoken: Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'ma be late, though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah
The Roc is definitely in the building
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh
I gotta say ""What's up"" to Tony Williams
On the vocals!
Sings—He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Ugh
And Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they asked me:
""Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?""
'Cause we takin these motherfuckers back to school
La, la, la, la-la-la-la la
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along
La la la la la, la-la-la

[Outro: Tony Williams & Kanye West]
Ba-dop-bop-ba (Oh)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feeling good)
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)
But we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
We want you to get used to this

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so

No matter where you go our love is true

Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

I ride on chrome, gone
We striving home

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (He's gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now
[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Break: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""78EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh
[Refrain]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying (Stop your cryin', baby)

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Refrain]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying

[Verse 2]
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right), that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
""I'll be there in five minutes,"" go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah

'Cause I'll erase away

Uh, uh, let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox, so the respect is due
Like my Louie bag, I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

[Verse 2: Common]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can’t break me down
(Jesus walks with me)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil tryin’ lure me, it fury me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor's shakin’ his head
He ain’t sure of me, but surely
(Jesus walks with me)
They asked, do you say your prayers at least two a week?
I ain’t talking to God, I know what I’ve been doin’ G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents
And I ain’t good, what they give us this day
The slaves is trying to give us this free
I’m trying to give us this pay
Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was
We was all ghetto fabulous
All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can’t decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
[Verse 3: Mase]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choices: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Mase]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
Now walk with me

You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of ""The Workout Plan"", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
First rule: stay away from the cupcakes
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
""But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though""
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes’ll like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, she claimed ""I can't tell""
But never say I can't sell
Pat, where we at right now, 3 mil?
Who the best? Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?
Who the rest now?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about

So, its crush time, Shawty show me you can do so

Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body

Lock them doors, don't tell nobody

And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?

""We don't care what people say""

[Kanye's cousin Kim]
""Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot!
Especially that song “Drug Dealer”
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour;
People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour
So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...
That they try to send their kids to school...
That they try to make a difference.""

Somebody get killed, the whole borough blame
M.A. dollar, what a thorough name
No matter who come through, I'm forever the king
I shoulda neva left the game, that's what a cutie said
Still chicks throwin' me up like newly weds
I'm grown and sexy, done with the groupie head
In the milk-white Phantom seats, and ruby red
You heard the rumor, listen to the facts
I drop my cars in pairs like pitty pat
When I'm done with this track, it feel like Biggie back
The game is country, I came to bring the city back
I came, I came to bring the city back
[Chorus: Ma$e]
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

Nobody wants a little tight ass!

Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album, but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was making a compilation
I was really making myself they compe-tation
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV, so it's All-Star trains
Just picture, man (Uh-huh), no snitchin', man (Uh-uh)
Something for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11, I was poor on the ave', 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm flooring the gas (Errr!)
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have (No more, ugh)
Well, Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
""Goddamn, Kanye!"" (""Kanye! Kanye!"")
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messing with me, dog
Now, you say it! (""Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!"")
I told dude, ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now, does that make me as rude as Jude?
(""When the album coming out?"") Man, the people is asking
Yamamoto, Adidas, he's sick with the fashion
You already got dough, so you spit for the passion (Ugh)
The way you rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man

How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights-out
After the sunshine, you thinking it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothing at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Aww) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up in them robbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma, but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashing (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weak, lame bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Ugh, ugh, ugh)

I'm over here chillin' with Kanye 'cause we got a lot in common, you know what I'm sayin'?
He got a unique style, I got a style of my own
I've been listening to the radio and shit and I've been hearing a lot of high pitch singy songs on the background
I'm like, yo, ""Yo, Kanye, that's your shit, that's your shit!""
He's like, ""Nah dawg""
So you you don't gotta be a mathematician or a muhfucking marine biologist to figure this shit out

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home

This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!

[Chorus: Kanye West with Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down

We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)

Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow!

Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is

Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases

One thing I've found, one thing I found

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self-down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong

Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay

Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love

I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped-up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then
[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)

You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(AH!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out
[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said ""Get It Wet""
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit, girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the Mocha Lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I gotta 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (Kweli)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now, I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named ""Cinnamon,"" more chips than Pentium
""What you gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryna spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back, like, ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean, twelve platinum chains—was I on that?

Now, even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand; let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head—that'll really piss him off

I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time—you gotta breathe!

And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus, I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now
[Chorus: Kanye West & Harlem Boys Choir]
Now throw your hands up (Throw your hands up high)
Hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody—fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words: Freeway; two letters: A-R
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words: fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through your car, my God
Two words: no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot, Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget your squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words: ""Send for the law,"" ugh
Two words: Freeway, slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad
[Outro: Mos Def & Harlem Boys Choir]
Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin', ""Who is that?""
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people, get this shit off your chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest

304,18,Through the Wire,238,Kanye West,The College Dropout,4342,"{'year': 2004, 'month': 2, 'day': 10}",Kanye West,"[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man

How's your son? (All the things)
He made the team this year? (All, all, all the things things)
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(...all all that glitters is not gold
And all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's your new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo
Of your granny's picture, now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah, you heard the track I did man, ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
[Chorus]
And I don't care 'bout
(All the diamond rings, all the diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
(All that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things
(Real is what you lease on me)

[Verse 2]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV!""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Aight, let's run it, let's run it
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking--

[Kanye West]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast, motherfucker!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""
[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

Throw your diamonds (Just let the beat ride out for a minute)

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Let's take it there, take it there, man
Champ 'posed to be, GLC
Can't be the champ, you ugly
GLC, where you at homie?

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights-out
After the sunshine, you thinking it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothing at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Aww) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up in them robbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma, but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashing (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weak, lame bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
And offers to sell and yell, ugh
[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life
Roc-A-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds

Think about it
Now I-
I'm over here chillin' with Kanye 'cause we got a lot in common, you know what I'm sayin'?
He got a unique style, I got a style of my own
I've been listening to the radio and shit and I've been hearing a lot of high pitch singy songs on the background
I'm like, yo, ""Yo, Kanye, that's your shit, that's your shit!""
He's like, ""Nah dawg""
So you you don't gotta be a mathematician or a muhfucking marine biologist to figure this shit out
Motherfuckers is bitin'
So please, do yourself and everybody else a favor
Take that style that you had
Put it in an UPS package and send it back to Kanye's house 'cause he want his style back8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Verse 1]
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama Benz, Jeep
With put fifty, I get this on the first tape
But that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
Back when Avi’s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, get crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, ""This car real old,"" I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'mma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside

[Chorus]
Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl

So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine""

Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbin', don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Rocawear
More popular, 'cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign, peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K

I know you're wondering, how is Kanye spittin' so hot?
'Cause I listen to the Roc and I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money, yeah, I know I'm a dummy
But what I'm supposed to tell a girl in the club
While that ass is getting feeled on
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children, feel him?
Probably not though, 'less you got dough, you know what I mean

Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this!""
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a Coupe

So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow

[Verse 1]
I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's
They told my Momma I was bipolar, had A.D.D
I told 'em w-what I wanna do
I wanna be a baller, the dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hating on you to their mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the ten-karat gold
That get green on you, when you get green on 'em
You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em
Somebody told me success is the best revenge
So they gon' be fucked up when you do your thing on 'em

Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hating, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'Cause we the leaders and they the followers
And we the nut busters and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, ""Oh you graduated?"" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay you or embarrass you
Come around with you, but they ain't down with you
They the dream killers
(Killer Norman Bates)

[Verse 3]
And I'm through spitting these rappers my most heartfelt flow
'Cause they be like, ""That's cool, you got some beats for me though?
Oh, I get it, you want to be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say
Anyway, what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out your house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out""
I even heard that they even taking wagers to jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, ""Peace?
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the East
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York? What, you ain't never took a tour there?

So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor

Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me

So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin' Alizé out the liquor aisle
She said, ""I hope it's not too ghetto""
Rocked all gold, force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin' wild
Like last week, I told her
""Take me to the mall"", but she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only one years old, oh

I'm in Noha, Honaloha, pushin' jet skis
So I couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun stayed down there
What's happenin' here made me wish I stayed down there

So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four, I ain't messin' with them girls no more

When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, ""You must love that car more than me
And nigga, I was with you before the cheese

Ah-ahem
This something I did
Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man...

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part-time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by five
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, dog, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in '95, she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in '92, I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, ""Yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel""
[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong? Yeah, I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet, looking for classes
Out of state though, man, that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do, she pouring out her heart
""You never listen to me,"" then the call drop, mm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal, I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal, I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money, so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see, can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
Went from fifty G's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call
One ring, two rings, seven rings, eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like, ""She in school and she don't stay here no more""
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise
[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
So I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No, no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
[Bridge]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true

Alright, is everybody ready? (Yeah!)
Alright, now, here we go
[Verse 1: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning, America, good morning to Erika
Who gave me good head while watching Good Morning America
Good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood lookin' for good yay to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy with good lies lookin' liable to try
You know that old sayin', what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed hits bad, so they hittin' licks bad
Had to get that work off, before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things'll only get bad
So now I'm gettin' bad scans, and I got that bad jam
Tellin' me them bad sense, songs catch them bad breaks
Caught a bad rate on the whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways, havin' a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly and my chain's ugly
Things became ugly 'cause my ugly rugby
Got a stain and it's musty, wakin' up lookin' crusty
And Ms. Thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""
I went from Pretty Willie to pretty silly without the pretty gully
So you know things'll still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning to um, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah, she ain't got a car, she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone, 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' Scary Movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge on a too-long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin you with them too long shoes"" And acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye, you don't love me?""
I told her it was good, it's too bad it got ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning to Queens, the Northside is my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'ma ride for my team
See, it's a beautiful life, but these bills'll make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcin' and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, when blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready turn it up in these streets, and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Ugly's with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bum me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly then leave the bar, abruptly
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words and say that's a bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chick with a bad perm
Who case took a bad turn, her face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about the bitch is bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad luck, our son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad luck
And once you get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meanin' bad, not ""bad"" meanin' good
But I agree that it's good, when you leave with the goods
It's all good in the hood, I call G.O.O.D. 'cause it's good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'ma make me a good wife
So I'm good to go, and I'm good where I go
'Cause my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came off for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper?
'Cause this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ayy, yo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

Where your plaques at, dog?
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker

Now, y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mama couldn't afford that abortion
Now, tell me, how the hell she gon' afford that coffin?
Now, I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this, like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it, I'm old-school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove coastal while they stayed local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down, I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now, after all that it took
I made it to the Roc—I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

Now, I show you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping, and I can't do nothing for you, man
Ask Gee and 'Hop, this 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn, I know you say, ""He's killing hisself""
""He got a little-bitty deal; now he feeling hisself""—yup!
Just 'cause I play beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to ""hospital you""
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little, you
Who your hypeman? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on the Fast and Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called ""Who's Laughing?""
The first producer that rap better than the rappers
[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album, but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was making a compilation
I was really making myself they compe-tation
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV, so it's All-Star trains
Just picture, man (Uh-huh), no snitchin', man (Uh-uh)
Something for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11, I was poor on the ave', 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm flooring the gas (Errr!)
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have (No more, ugh)
Well, Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
""Goddamn, Kanye!"" (""Kanye! Kanye!"")
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messing with me, dog
Now, you say it! (""Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!"")
I told dude, ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now, does that make me as rude as Jude?
(""When the album coming out?"") Man, the people is asking
Yamamoto, Adidas, he's sick with the fashion
You already got dough, so you spit for the passion (Ugh)
The way you rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that, man
You eating up the game like Pac-Man
And got the whole world shaking just like crack fiends

Champ 'posed to be, GLC
Can't be the champ, you ugly
GLC, where you at homie?

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights-out
After the sunshine, you thinking it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothing at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Aww) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up in them robbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma, but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashing (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weak, lame bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Ugh, ugh, ugh)

He got a unique style, I got a style of my own
I've been listening to the radio and shit and I've been hearing a lot of high pitch singy songs on the background
I'm like, yo, ""Yo, Kanye, that's your shit, that's your shit!""
He's like, ""Nah dawg""
So you you don't gotta be a mathematician or a muhfucking marine biologist to figure this shit out

Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The Roc got 'Ye, but they ain't snorting it
They just got him up at Baseline, recording shit
Yeah, I been broke—now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood-rich
So I say ""my way"" to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else: Thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I been beaten, but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said, ""We free at last""
Ain't nothing free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast

Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!

Niggas ain't believe me 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely getting head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway just like it's a relay
We stay four-stars or better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter when we could afford better
And back before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay getting something off lay-away at Marshall's

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said ""It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me""
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!""
But if you really cared for her
Then you woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, ""You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new""
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town
[Chorus: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home

(You got to...) Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long, man, we back in town

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you ""bye""
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on ""The Champions"" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats
[Verse 3: Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

[Hook: (Consequence)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Yo, 'Quence?)
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

[Verse 4: Consequence]
'Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose-gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say, ""He don't look like a thug or a hood""
""But he keep them gorillas, so he still be good""
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out in N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm saying I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat
[Verse 6: Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

[Verse 7: Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and then call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

[Verse 8: Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

[Hook: {Consequence} (Kanye West)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Kon Man Produc'!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (yeah! yeah!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (It's the ROC!)

I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
(Oh when it all)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this!""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...

[Verse 1]
Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died
Sold 6.5 'cept I'm comin' from the Chi
[Hook]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

[Verse 2]
Now even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my concerts lately, they be linin' up
You ain't seen my girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
And they heard about my girl so I still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in the wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
Far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, 10/23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me, I took the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a Midwest thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you could run around like King of the Chi
But God could take that in a blink of a eye
I remember Cedars-Sinai and all those cryin'
Mama, I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Alwe G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma John Monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina, we gon' take 'em to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West, the college dropout slash genius
[Hook]

[Outro]
Now if the Roc is in the building say, ""Hell yeah!""
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, ""Hell yeah!""
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, ""Hell yeah!""
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Now keep 'em in the air

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean two platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?

That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?

For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
(There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2Pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man
[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may

For a chance at loving you
(And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
All they heard was I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Outro: Elton John]
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Calm down, get back, ghetto people got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
We won't stop shit—everybody move!

Two words: Chi-Town, Southside, worldwide
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint, five mics
Go-Getters rhyme like should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop player-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words: Chi-Town raised me, crazy
So I live by two words: ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screaming, ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God—it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus, I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now

Two words: no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot, Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget your squad, better fend for yourself

How'd that song go I did with Hov? Oh yeah, shit'll never change
That's your worry, though, we are the champions
Spend a lot of time in Hampt-i-ons, do a lot of beats you can't be on
Damn, all these fans can't be wrong, damn, B.I.G., you can't be gone
Make those beats thugs wanna rock (Yeah), make a nigga feel just like Pac (Yeah)

Came in the game, changed it again, changed everything, yeah
If you feeling this here, throw your fucking hands in the air

[Verse 2: Young Chris & Beanie Sigel]
It's the Roc-a-Fella label, baby, fuck them other labels, baby

[Verse 4: Cam'Ron]
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes, every day a frisk was at stake
Jakes' cuffs, wrists getting raped, my mission was straight, to
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped the bird at em, flip a bird, switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look, we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar and Magic, oh my God, it's magic
Isaiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket

Tossing they wigs, make corpse of they kids

I'm 95 South, no doubt, MAC clip in
I stack chips and I'm Saks Fifth-in'
Louis Vuitton loafers, hat dripping
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up, put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me, shit
It had three felons, gun shooters, no
50 cal. A.C.P., Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid, though, I get scrilla, man
I'm for realer, man, yeah, it's Killa Cam, uh, Dipset, bitch

Fuck a battle, nigga, I'ma get them thangs
Rollin' with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gon' make 'em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy that's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm finna be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Taking it to some motherfuckers domes
'Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Filling my body with lead, clutching chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provoking when I'm smoking sess
And we getting stronger, hope you got a vest
Already got them MACs, already got them TECs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearl

Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevara
Now it's a whole museum of Hov MC'ers
Everybody dupin' the flow—you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like they tryna make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjust to the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like, ""Oh shit, he's so handsome""
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnapped rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back, no rap
Young Hov's going to Canton, I'ma land ya

For those that think Hov fingers bling-blingin'
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is
And single that out to be the meaning of what he's about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no, dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album with to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Geah, you jingling, baby
See, I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
""Oh, he's good""
""No, he would never sell out, he's so hood""

Shopping while I'm zooted off the dro
Rolling like a nigga that just came up on a mil'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the floor
Bag full of clothes, I remember having rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Serving up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yourself
When you come up on some cheddar, better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go up to the lot
And lay the paper down to cop that Jag'
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jax and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1's
No max for none
(When I go up in the store, a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller, if you want it, come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car, you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be chopping up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizzay

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
My throwback game is whiffle-wicked
Saint Patty's Day, green pinstripe
Number 20, Mark Spitz'n'
Jersey, ooh-wee, with the matching New Era fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin'
Keeping coke in the kitchen
Keep a Glock that'll shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness
I'm scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two-deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside, holla, Felli Fel
More G's on me than a late-eighties Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan
Old man with the gun in hand, I leave your blood squirtin'
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy, speak easy
Slight with the fighting words
I'll put something hot through your motherfucking Iceberg
Got a project chica named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro, reefer
Small baby-black gat tucked in her Baby Phat
I rock some, roll chief sacks like Daddy Fat
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown, Jay-Z, & Big Boi]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught, ugh)
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought (Bought)
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags (Bags)
'Cause we be poppin' tags (Geah), pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught)
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought (Woo)
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags (I'm poppin')
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you laying on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your mama in all-black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call 'cause your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox 'pecting a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means ""Movie Date,"" ""Dinner Date,"" ""Lunch Date,"" help me
Please, my cheese is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimp-ously serve the song
Act a damn donkey like the pilgrims
When they popped the tag on the Indians' home
Drop top rag-o with the wind going
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of F.A.O. Schwartz for the chil'ens
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kidding
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the Honeycombs?
Oh now, you acting mad
'Cause the money done slowed down, just a lil bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall, bull-pit, dead game is the pulpit
Leave a motherpumper with his ""John Doe"" toe-tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike, and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and snappin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
No politics, swallow and keep the change

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Jay-Z]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (Caught, ugh)
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought (Bought)
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags (Bags)

It's (a million)

[Hook: Kanye West]
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Look, lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check by check
If ""H to the Izzo"" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like, ""You don't care about my son's feelings?""
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!
[Hook: Kanye West]
How many years did I wait? About (a million)
How many niggas tryin' to hate? About (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's 'bout (a million)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I'm supposed to style, I'm the fly-boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice in the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit résumés is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Masta Ace's
""Stand Up"", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubblegum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

We make the squares dance, and get the do like dosey
Y'all niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary yo
Swooping the industry, like a bird to prey
My stanzas has got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
I write screen gems y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the ""Buffalo Soldier"", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high
Like you holding blow in a stolen whip, rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops, now that's a 4 alarm

How many niggas really think they thugs

How many niggas can't get in with hats and sneakers on
Say 'fuck security' and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part
I'd rather jump over board nigga, face the sharks
We stay doing it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waiting, niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found popping shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my House, you ain't no real Representative

So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best

Hang up on niggas like 'I want you to meet my nigga tone, word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson

Alright, is everybody ready? (Yeah!)
Alright, now, here we go
[Verse 1: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning, America, good morning to Erika
Who gave me good head while watching Good Morning America
Good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood lookin' for good yay to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy with good lies lookin' liable to try
You know that old sayin', what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed hits bad, so they hittin' licks bad
Had to get that work off, before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things'll only get bad
So now I'm gettin' bad scans, and I got that bad jam
Tellin' me them bad sense, songs catch them bad breaks
Caught a bad rate on the whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways, havin' a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly and my chain's ugly
Things became ugly 'cause my ugly rugby
Got a stain and it's musty, wakin' up lookin' crusty
And Ms. Thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""
I went from Pretty Willie to pretty silly without the pretty gully
So you know things'll still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning to um, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah, she ain't got a car, she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone, 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' Scary Movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge on a too-long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin you with them too long shoes"" And acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye, you don't love me?""
I told her it was good, it's too bad it got ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me

And this is for the hood, you got to love me

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning to Queens, the Northside is my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'ma ride for my team
See, it's a beautiful life, but these bills'll make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcin' and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, when blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready turn it up in these streets, and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Ugly's with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bum me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly then leave the bar, abruptly
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words and say that's a bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chick with a bad perm
Who case took a bad turn, her face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about the bitch is bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad luck, our son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad luck
And once you get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meanin' bad, not ""bad"" meanin' good
But I agree that it's good, when you leave with the goods
It's all good in the hood, I call G.O.O.D. 'cause it's good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'ma make me a good wife
So I'm good to go, and I'm good where I go
'Cause my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came off for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper?
'Cause this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ayy, yo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

Yo, I come from a crack in the ground, a hole in the wall
And dog, when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
Or eat you from the inside and hollow you up
And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
And it's sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons, punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced, a rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route
And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out, really, tryin to weed it out
Know the flipside, we choosin your way

And this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills and purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold
But you know that's how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
And make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry
Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jays, climbin those stairways
Hoping, Heaven's gates wide open for me
Look towards Allah, Sig in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin direction
Tryna balance out the good with the imperfections

Just to make it to the bottom, see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom

See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
And let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit
I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of Allah

[Intro]
To my nigga
Brought me in this world
Ha, that's right, nigga

[Verse 1]
My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late, but always came home
My moms would put us to bed, and she would wait on
Soon as he walked in the door, she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day
Mama was either home or at work
While we playing inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone
Peeping out the window, heated
But still, I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids, younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things, that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and my mom's love
[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was
That's why I show my pop love
'Cause he was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death, but stayed
Watched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
""What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you not my mommy!""
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promised me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommey
He said one day I'll understand—
""Little me, what's in you is inside me""
[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 3]
Pops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home
Could I help it, ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""?
Who loved the pretty brown round, out-of-town-bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home, I played his latest recordings
And it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
Our weed habits the same now
No white lines, or trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that's bumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together, then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid
Life goes on...5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said ""It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me""
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!""
But if you really cared for her
Then you woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, ""You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new""
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town
[Chorus: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home

There's gonna be some shit you might not understand but, you may have to rewind this shit a few times. Heaven, heaven. Check it out

[Verse 1: Scarface]
I know tomorrow ain't a promise, that's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your family's your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying, ""Back in the days""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
My angel, my sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend, my good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
[Verse 2: Scarface]
Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life and it was like
Heaven, but I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven

[Outro: Scarface]
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the reverend
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to heaven1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us

But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, ""Fuck this dude""
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone, ""Ay"", I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block

Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it

And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day

Spot my enemy and kill him the American way

Get sexed on a regular basis, grown women puttin' they faces
In all the wrong places, molesting me, now you see why my destiny
Was fucked up cuz my recipe
But I blame my mother cuz I can't blame no other
And that's how my game was discovered
My mom was a sucker, did that bullshit to my brother
But no matter what, I'mma love her
She gave me life, even though she got high undercover
If she die, I can't find me another
But look what you made me
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am

[Verse 2: Meeno]
Yeah, you made me this way, since the day I was born
When you slid on that crack shit, mom be strong
'Fore long, I realized the same old song
Another cat that done bounced on his kid and his spouse
At the beginning, I knew my pops just had to be kidding
He's coming back any day, he wouldn't leave us that way
But anyway, the time got longer, my anger got stronger
It's no time to wonder the money I hunger
Without a blunder, I vowed to be all I could be
Started running guns O.T., me and my code D
Leave from the backstreets of A-T-L to N-Y-C
When the gunspot got hot, I switched to the D
When the D spot got hot, I went low key
Now that Harlem World spot hot, and I'm on TV
I don't need no fake calls from yo' ass at all
Just leave me the way you left me and watch me ball
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am

[Bridge: Nas]
What, what, uh
You the reason
And I thank you, what
Check it out

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, yo, stormy night, September '73
Would you believe what my mom recieved from heaven was me?
Second from me, my younger brother desperate as me
We see the world alike, type of girls he likes, the girls I like
The shit that make him mad, it make me hype, bug like that
Share the same blood like that, grew up around thugs poppin' and shit
Cardboard boxes and shit, dirt bikes
But now we hoppin' whips and merc, right?
Money's my birthright, my righteous birth so I floss
It's up to you to look inside yourself, see what's yours
Consecutive times, New Year's Eve, light off nines in the skylines
Imaginary graves, poor the Henney on it
Share with my dogs who's here, cuz there's so many gone
Yeah, Meeno, Ill Will, all my people
Big Stretch, we'll never forget, Allah keeps you
Until we meet again, through my pen y'all can speak through, uh
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

(Nigga, uh)
Yeah, huh (nigga uh)
Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
(Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh)

[Verse 1]
At the age of fourteen, introduced to coupes
Learnin' how to seduce niggas takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, in 9th grade flauntin'
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life
While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke
You was my sister, we used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it
[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

[Verse 2]
Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing
Age 4 in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing
And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing
Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born
Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom
Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?
But he never showed up
I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?
Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me hurl
'Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls
All I needed was love, all I wanted was love
Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs
The niggas who ain't care, just like Daddy
If he ain't care, why should they?
For this 'high price' life, it's the price I pay
[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

[Verse 3]
All my girls cross the world that feel what I feel
Hearts bruised, then been way I been, keep it movin'
Let him do his thing, I'm the one he's lovin'
I'm here to show ya'll, havin' a kid ain't meanin' nuthin'
That ain't keepin' him, 'specially if he in love with another chick
Then you stuck with the 'babymother-shit'
Don't be lovin' niggas more than yaself
Let 'em roam, a dog always finds his way home
Shit, ya'll don't wanna take my place, catchin' cases
Spit in faces I never seen falsely accused
While some say it's rude
But if I was a dude, they all be amused
But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that
Double-standards, call him a Mack, call me a ho
Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me
What the fuck he in it for?
Wanted it all, now it's all mine
Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain
Nightmares, headlines, ""Rapper found slain""
If it wasn't for my moms I'd drown in this pain
Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me
Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV
Shit, but this is my '9 to 5' ya'll
Sometimes I wanna slit my wrist and end my life ya'll
[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?

– Hahaha, word up?
– You know you like a Donald Goines, nigga. That's off top
I got bills and shit to pay
And another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto
– That's right, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout, tell the, tell the young boys out there, man
– Takin' it back on some soulful type shit, Hip-Hop in it's rare form
Spend a dollar on some wine
Hand my clothes out on the line, I'm ghetto
– Now ya'll niggas wanna wear Polo and Hilfiger
– Dreamin' all of this riches, dreamin' all of this bitches
See me cruisin' down the lane
Doin' two miles per hour, baby, I'm ghetto
– Y'all wanna go places like Vegas and Beverly Hills like every three seconds
– We just wanna talk to ya'll, tell ya'll a lil' somethin'
I'm not ashamed of my Fam
I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto
– I tell the story for the young black youths out there

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yo, it started out in East New York, where I grew up
Knew how to walk, favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers
Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar, starvin' for mine
Bust three at ya, dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy
Moms dropped him on the spot, smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
That's ya Pops, still, thats me still, keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out
Three days away from home he stoned out (Stoned out)
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son, I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul (Yo, why you doin' that?)
But gettin' big, half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh, shit, got this bitch seeded, cop pleaded
What to do? knock your self off, God succeeded
And the most scariest part? Better have heart
Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Make a brick and get barred, shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black carry-on, ready to die for the family hard
Alcoholic vultures with toasters, sheep skins on
Leather V Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit
Smoke a bag of wet and set it, the block we deaded
Society wrong, we too black and too strong to prolong
Got my woman with a gun in her thong
It's kinda wild how we livin', the Devil fall has arisen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders
That's real, cause we need them and they need us
That's wealth for ya, leavin' on this moment
Meditate, four in the Mornin', nigga, you straight
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
I got hustlin' on my mind
Otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car
At the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto, yeah
See me cruisin' down the lane
Two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam
I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

[Verse 2: Madd Rapper]
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter
My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it, didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx
Knowin' all along the shit was wrong
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last it keeps goin' on
So keep movin' on, same old story, my Pops left
Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex, with around the way bitches
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps
I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood
[Chorus: Carl Thomas & Madd Rapper]
I got bills and shit to pay
And another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto
(This goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all around the nation and all around the World, knowhatI'msayin'?)
Spend a dollar on some wine
Hang my clothes out on the line, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane

I speak the truth
Truth, nothin' but the truth
Y'all know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth, nothing but the truth

[Verse 1]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know, I'm known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down tracks, DAT's, reels and slaves
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats tote Mac's to rap
Y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untamed
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before ya honor he couldn't peep my game
Gotta laugh, don't act like we spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game?
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig'?

[Chorus]
Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga, the truth
[Verse 2]
Ain't nuthin' changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed? That's fine, still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin' and bitchin'
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin'
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin' like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin' coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed, it's on
Motherfucker

Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be

[Verse 3]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin' your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

[Chorus]
Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you

Geah.. whassup?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister going make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
[Verse 3: Scarface]
Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

I'm just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I don't control the colors

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like ""Mack maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace
Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement
There that voice go again ""Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin' of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb

[Verse 2]
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Qur'an and 48 laws, they polish my flaws
I'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mack was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shinin' at night
Imagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But I'm walkin' on air, breakin' every gravity law
It's nothin' like it, I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
It's nothin' like it
[Interlude]
Goddamn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

[Verse 3]
I changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
Try to tell them ""you can burn young punk without smellin' the fumes""
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I'm paintin', it's so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
I'm loadin' up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise it's like jihad with these mags, I'ma bust ya

Let's rock
[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins, got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
I Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clap that chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Still not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! (Vamoose, son of a bitch!)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture
To let them know what ya boy look like when ya boy in that Roadster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging labels for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
They acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
That's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game: the two things that's great
H O V A
(What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy)
Yeah!

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
What's up? Cats all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young cats gettin' at me, young rappers spittin' at me
My homie Big predicted this thing exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems""- gotta move carefully
Cause cat hate when you getting money like athletes
Young'ns ice-grilling me, ohh - you not feeling me?
Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, they all need hugs
Damn little man I'm just trying do me
If the record's two mil you know I'm trying move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, yo I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing
Where's the love?

[Hook (Jaguar Wright)]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
[Verse 2]
And then the Fugees gonna break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got something to say
What's all the fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
They pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you cats I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam
Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love?

[Hook (Jaguar Wright)]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Everybody let's take em to church
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
[Verse 3]
Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up and Ike and Tina
Turner
Break up then I wake up to more bullsh
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this sh
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me sh - where's the love?

[Hook]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no love in the heart of town)
Ain't no
I like that start again
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I am a Roc representer (Oh)
Summer to winter (Oh), dead or alive (Uh)
24/7, three-sixty-five
One CD or three hundred and sixty pies
What's up to E and Kirk? Welcome home to Taj
Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (Uh)
We run streets like drunks run streetlights
We collidin' with life as we speak
We knee-deep in coke, we key-deep in ice
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week, he's broke
'Cause when you sleep, he's reachin' for your throat
Word on the street, you reap what you sow
Not out of fear, but love, love for the game
Roc family first, we never change, man
[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change)

Death before dishonor, correct?
Yup, that's what you promised me since the Bomber League
Along with if we stay strong
We can get paper longer than Pippen's arms (Woo)
Plead the Fifth when it comes to the fam
I'm like a dog, I never speak, but I understand
Where my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war?
Where your balls at? Woah, gotta pause that (Woah)
Lost ninety-two bricks, had to fall back
Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back
Had A1 credit, got more crack
From the first to the fifth, gave it all back
If I'm not a hustler, what you call that?
This is before rap ('Fore), this is all fact (Fact), I never change
[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change)

Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change, c'mon)
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I'll never change

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
'Fore the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly
Well, fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari
Was so young, my big sis still playin' with Barbie
Young brother, big city, eight million stories
Old heads taught me, ""Youngin, walk softly""
Carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy
Chains is cool to cop, but more important is lawyer fees (Uh)
That's how it is now (Uh), that's how it always be (Uh)
I never change, this is always me
From the womb to the tomb, from now 'til my doom
Drink Army from one cup, pass it around the room (That's a family, nigga)
That's the ritual (Yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up, I'll never change

I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change, c'mon)

Yeah uh uh...This ain’t nothin’ but a little story
I know that each one of y’all done been here before
(Tell it [?], tell it!)

[Chorus]
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
I love you in them jeans, you everything I need
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
I come to your crib, you fix me chicken wings
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl (Yeah, yeah)
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing (I met you in the mall)
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything (I met you in the mall, yeah)
When I was hustling, girl, you kept them things

[Verse 1]
I met you in the mall, when I was hustling, tryna ball
I told Timmy, “Pause, playa, watch me get this broad”
Stack in my pocket, dawg, how is she gon’ tell me no?
I felt like Brady when the Patriots won the Super Bowl
No time for stupid hoes, girl, I want you to know
Girl, I think you’re beautiful and I ain’t tryna hit them drawers
Hustling and pimpin’ and mackin’ not stacking but slacking and rappin’ and tapping not laughing but scrappin’ and jackin’, yeah
I used to pull ‘em doe, and that’s what I was doin’
I used to play the game, now I ride the bench like Ewing
You made me chill that shit ‘cause bein’ with you, I benefit
Ain’t no nigga as real as this, now close your eyes and feel this dick
Took me three months to hit it, I had to go get it
Never waited that long for nothing ‘cause I’m a Go Getter that’s hustlin’
(Clever) in havin’ some something, (Heaven) is yours if you want it
(Baby) I’m not just performing, (Thank you) for being my woman
[Chorus]
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
I love you in them jeans, you everything I need
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything (Yeah, one more)
When I was hustling, girl, you kept them things

[Verse 2]
I helped you pay your bills, I’m happy that your hair is real
You got me spinnin’ hoes like we on a Ferris wheel
I’m GLC but to you I’m Leonard Harris still
Never was impressed, rims spinnin’ like a carousel
House got burned, like that kerosine, you was down my queen
You was everything I need, broke arm you my sling
Now I charm you with rings, now our lawn got some swings
Wintertime and we gone with some skis
I was in the streets actin’ wild, with a smile (No, I’m sick and tired of this sh—)
You would say, “Calm down, stop actin’ like a child”
We would fight, we would fuss, we would holler, we would argue
(Girl) you deserve the spotlight, I let you spit a bar too

[Chorus]
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl ([?])
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
I love you in them jeans, you everything I need
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
I come to your crib, you fix me chicken wings
She my life, my love, she my heart, my girl
My queen, it’s a dream, you got me in this thing
Good between the sheets, but that ain’t everything
When I was hustling, girl, you kept them things
